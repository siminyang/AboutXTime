**About X Time** is an app designed to record precious memories, deliver surprises, and share feelings. With it, you can create your own "time capsule," adding text, photos, voice messages, videos, locations, and time stamps, and set a future date to unlock it, allowing your feelings to resurface on a special day. You can also add a sense of mystery for friends or co-created capsules, and open them together when the time comes, reminiscing about the good times. 

Whether for personal memories or shared experiences with friends, the Time Capsule brings endless emotions and delightful surprises!
